# Vertical Edge and Line_Detector
Numpy Based Edge Detector using edge detection kernels. Implemented from scratch using only numpy for processing. Outputs higher number in case of detected edges, and outputs lower number in case no edges (Number itself depends on amount of edges detected). 
 
# Object Detection-YOLO V3
Object detection is one of the most researched and utilized topic in Applied AI real world problems. 

YOLO V3 Provides a DarkNet Backend framework to detect objects in real time, it can go as fast as 30fps of real time object detection and classification, This make YOLO V3 one of the widely used models. 

The Notebook contains a fully functional YOLOV3 Model, whcih can be tuned for your specific purpose accordingly.
